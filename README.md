# Overview

The examples available in this repository cover several processing steps, from pre-processing, processing and post-processing. The methods already available are described below.

## Pre-Processing

* 
<!--
The preprocessing step involves filtering, smoothing, data segmentation and feature extraction.
-->

## Processing

<!--
Methods for classification or regression.
-->

* [K-Nearest Neighbors](K-Nearest%20Neighbors)
* [Support Vector Machine](Support%20Vector%20Machine)

## Pos-Processing

<!--
reliability
-->

* 

# How To Use
